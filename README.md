# PFinance 

In this project, I created a personal finance app that allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. The app uses core data for data management.
The records are persisted locally in the built-in database, so you should see the records even after restarting the app.

# What did I learn?

1. How to build a form and perform validation
2. How to filter records and refresh the listview
3. How to use bottom sheet to display record details
4. How to use MVVM(Model-View-View-Model) in SwiftUI
5. How to save and manage data in a database using CoreData
6. How to use Date Picker for date selection
7. How to handle keyboard notification and adjust the form position

# How it could be better

- Ability to log in and log out
- Ability to transfer money and/or cryptocurrencies to close friends
- Ability to deposit checks
- Ability to keep track of digital receipts
